## data-driven-power-flow-linearization

This code studies a linearized PF model through a data-driven approach.

The model is proposed in paper: Yuxiao Liu, Ning Zhang, Yi Wang, Jingwei Yang, Chongqing Kang,["Data-Driven Power Flow Linearization: A Regression Approach"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320726856_Data-Driven_Power_Flow_Linearization_A_Regression_Approach), published on IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid

This source code is distributed in the hope that it will be helpful for your research and personal use. Any commercial/business use should be agreed by the authors of the above mentioned paper.

We do request that publications in which this code is adopted, explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the above mentioned paper.

Note that the Matpower platform and the matlab python engine is required in this code.
